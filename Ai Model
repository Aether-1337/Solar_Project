New Features: Made with Claude 

Machine Learning Model: Uses Gradient Boosting Regressor (one of the most powerful ML models) trained on all historical observations to predict future solar activity
Advanced Feature Engineering:

Lagged values (1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months back)
Rolling statistics (means and standard deviations)
Cyclical time features (sine/cosine for seasonality)
Rate of change calculations


8 Advanced Visualizations:

Full timeline comparison (Observed, NOAA, ML predictions)
Recent 10-year activity with future predictions
Distribution analysis of solar activity
Annual statistics (mean, min, max ranges)
Feature importance chart (shows which factors matter most)
ML vs NOAA prediction comparison
Prediction confidence intervals
Residual analysis (model accuracy check)


Performance Metrics: Shows RMSE and R² score to validate model accuracy
Detailed Summary: Prints predictions for 12, 24, and 60 months ahead with comparisons

The ML model learns patterns from the entire historical dataset and can identify complex relationships that simple models might miss. It should provide interesting comparisons with NOAA's official predictions
